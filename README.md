# HOW TO RUN THE CODE

- Please run the download.ipynb file FIRST
- This will install all neccesary datasets to run the code
- AFTER running the download.ipynb, Please run notebooks in order, starting from Notebook 1, ending at Notebook 5

# Directory




- `raw_data`: will be filled when running the download.ipynb file
- `preprocessed data`: Contains all the preprocessed data files. Will be filled after running notebook 2.
- `plots`: All plots containted here.
- `code`: Contains all notbooks, should be run in the following order
    - download.ipynb
    - Notebook 1 External dataset
    - Notebook 2 Preprocessing
    - Notebook 3 Visualisation
    - Notebook 4 Modelling
    - Notebook 5 Results
- `deprecated`: A folder to store "old code" that **you do not use anymore** or code that you experimented with, but decided to not go ahead. This is useful in case you ever need to come back to an older iteration of code or to express your other approaches to the problem.
